## Data

The dataset used in this project is the [Diwali Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/diwali-sales-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains the following columns:

The dataset originally has 11251 rows and 15 columns.

2. **Removing Duplicates**: 8 duplicate rows were identified and removed.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: 12 missing values in the `Amount` column were dropped.

After cleaning, the dataset contains 11231 rows and 13 columns.
